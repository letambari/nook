							<div class="services__text">In 2019 when we first launched the Port Harcourt Fashion and Design week brand, the theme of the event was ‚ÄúFashion‚Ä¶the new Oil and Gas‚Äù The essence was to draw attention to the creative industry, celebrate Sme‚Äôs who are already making impact in that sector and encourage youths who had interest in the industry to genuinely pursue their interest. Port Harcourt Hitherto have been known as the Oil rich city and youths who could not find themselves in the oil and gas sector felt out of place. That narrative needed to change and we were able to achieve it through the Master classes facilitated by veterans of the Fashion Industry, Lexy Mojo Eyes, Frank Osodi, celebrity makeup artist, Marco Louis who came all the way from South Africa to teach and inspire our youths, entrepreneurship coach and formal president of the Port Harcourt Chamber of Commerce Engr. Emeka Unachukwu and Mrs Gift Nwankwo.</div>

							<div class="services__text">This year, thanks to the Vlisco Creative Promise in Fashion Contest of 2019, many of the youths are ready and so eager to see what the fashion week holds for them, as they cannot wait to unveil their creative skills while we intend to bring to the attention of the government and policy makers, how much this industry can help in Revitalizing the economy of the state while establishing port Harcourt as a tourist destination.</div>
							<div class="services__text">It is on this premise that that this year‚Äôs theme, ‚ÄúRevitalizing the Economy through Fashion Tourism" was borne.</div>
						
                        <div class="services__text">During the Fashion Week, the idea is for the world to beam its light on the city of Port Harcourt, enjoying the culture and sophistication that abound with the people.</div>
